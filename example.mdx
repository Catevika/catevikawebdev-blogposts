## Table of contents

## Introduction

- My first thought was to use [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), like the vast majority of bloggers. But one of my concern was about the [security issues](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wordpress-security-issues) linked to this CMS - Content Management System.

- Then I wanted my blog to be part of my existing website.

- As a Frontend Developer with [React](https://react.dev/) expertise, I finally opted for the [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) framework.
